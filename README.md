# Hi, I'm Alexander Maldonado üöÄ

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a Data Analyst and Economist from Honduras with over 7 years of experience leveraging the full data lifecycle to drive strategic decisions. My journey has taken me through government, the private sector, and international organizations, where I've used data to optimize processes, understand customer behavior, and support public policy for vulnerable populations.

My passion lies in transforming complex data into actionable insights, and I am always deepening my expertise in Data Science and Machine Learning.
